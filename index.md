# About

Hi! I’m Maria Arzumanov, but you can call me Masha. I'm a PhD student at the [Political Science Department](https://polisci.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, where I study gender and the political economy of reproductive healthcare in the US. I hold an MSc in Political Science and Political Economy from the London School of Economics, and a BA in Economics from the University of British Columbia. Before my PhD, I worked at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) at MIT.

Currently, I am an an affiliate of the [California Center for Population Research](https://ccpr.ucla.edu/), and a Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) at the [Center for Impact](https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/about/centers/impactanderson). My work has been partially funded by the [Institute for Humane Studies](https://www.theihs.org/).
